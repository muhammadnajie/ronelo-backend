[uwsgi]
; Use this file to run the application with uwsgi locally using <uswgi dev.ini>

; Where app.py is the python file containing the callable app object
module = app:app

; This could optinally be achieved with
; wsgi-file = app.py
; callable = app

; For local development only. The app will be available at localhost:5000
http = :5000

; A master process will respawn processes when they die
master = true

; By default uWSGI starts with a single process and a single thread
; We'll start with 4 processes 
processes = 4

; Each process will have 2 threads
threads = 2
